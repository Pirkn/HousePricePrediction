Prediction Score: 0.12438 (RMSE)

## Key Components

### Data Preparation
- **Proper DTypes**: Ensuring data types of each feature accurately reflect their content for easier manipulation.
- **Handle Missing Values**: Strategies for identifying and imputing missing values in both categorical and numerical columns.

### Feature Transformation
- **Skewed Numeric Features Transformation**: Techniques to normalize distributions of numeric features.
- **Categorical Features Transformation**: Methods to encode categorical variables for machine learning models.
- **Target Transformation**: Adjusting the target variable to improve model accuracy.
- **Scale Data**: Scaling features to prepare for model training.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- **Split Data**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- **Compare Models**: Analyzing different machine learning models to identify the most suitable for predicting house prices.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to apply comprehensive data preprocessing techniques and model comparison strategies to accurately predict house prices. It serves as a practical example of the data science workflow, from initial data cleaning to model selection and evaluation.

## Dataset Source
The dataset for this project was obtained from a [Kaggle competition]([https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)). This competition provides a challenging dataset that requires extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering to predict house prices accurately.
